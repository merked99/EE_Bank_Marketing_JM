Abstract:
A marketing campaign for a banking institution in Portugal was conducted. The marketing campaign collected data via phone calls. To predict whether or not clients would subscribe to a term deposit, several classification machine learning algorithms were applied. Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and random forest classifier had the highest accuracy when classifying whether a participant would subscribe for a term deposit. LightGBM is generally better at handling larger datasets when compared to Random Forests and thus provides better computation for this classification task.
